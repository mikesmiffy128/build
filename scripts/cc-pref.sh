# This file is dedicated to the public domain.

# to make it as easy as possible for users to reproduce builds (and to make it
# as easy as possible for me to test-compile on supported platforms), we try to
# use the native compiler that ships will each stable OS release - except on
# linux, since every distro is different. in that case I happen to use the
# latest stable clang, so that's the canonical preferred linux compiler for the
# project.

# if some other random compiler is used, it'll probably still be fine, but if
# something goes wrong, these warnings aim to prompt the user to try the thing
# that Works On My Machineâ„¢
