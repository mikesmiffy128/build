Some random notes on the task database (db.c)

* Small chunks of string-based data get stored as dangling symlinks: a full read
  or write is 1 syscall instead of at least 3, and the actual on-disk storage
  just plonks the data in the inode which is really fast and space-efficient.

* "Newness:" what the heck is newness? Well, if task A depends on task B and B
  is our goal and gets updated, if we then run with an up-to-date A as a goal
  then nothing will happen since it doesn't know task B is changed. To solve
  this, every task has a newness which increases whenever it's updated, and
  counts towards considering other tasks (the dependents) as out-of-date. Of
  course, A might have also ran a bunch of times so we can't just increase a
  per-task counter, we have to maintain a global monotonic counter for the whole
  dependency database.

  Internally, a newness of 0 also indicates that a task was just requested for
  the first time, so it definitely has to be run (no need to even check for
  dependencies).

  Another option would be to just use a monotonic wall-clock timestamp (ie TAI),
  but this doesn't actually exist because computers are made by stupid people.
  Plus the time might be set wrong anyway (see also: why comparing file
  timestamps on infiles is a bad idea).
