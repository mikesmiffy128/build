Ensure portability
====
In no particular order: Linux with glibc, Linux with musl, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD and illumos are all supported. I call that a win.

Other more obscure platforms can still get added later, but that's trivial work,
so the initial TODO is considered DONE!

Hooray for virtual machines!
