Ensure portability
====
This is mostly done, just illumos isn't testable for some reason. But that's not
too bad: we already support *most* of the major open source platforms and don't
do anything that should be too hard to make work on other platforms.

Once illumos is known to work, this can get closed as far as I'm concerned.
