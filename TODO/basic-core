Basic job queueing and dependency tracking
====
Draw some circles first, before trying to draw the rest of the owl.

At this point we have process scheduling basically done, along with input file
change checking and storing task results.

All that's really left to do is propagate up-to-date-ness to dependencies. Oh,
and support dependendencies, along with all the relevant IPC stuff. And fix a
bunch of robustness issues etc.
