Terminal UI improvements
====
The compact single-line thing has grown on me so I don't really wanna change
that, but I do wanna replace "last done" with "last started and still running"
which will probably come about alongside the stderr scheduling stuff. Oh yeah,
we also want to do that - order the error outputs in some way rather than just
dumping them willy nilly.
