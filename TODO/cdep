Proper C/C++/ObjC dependency analyser
====
Right now build itself uses scripts/cdep to get header dependencies, and that
works well enough because there's no conditional includes, generated headers or
very complex include paths in this project.

However, for general-purpose stuff it would be good to have a real program for
the purpose of figuring out which headers are used. Ideally it would essentially
implement the same logic as a C preprocessor so it looks things up in the same
way as an actual compiler.
