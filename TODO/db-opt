Think of ways to optimise .builddb
====
There's a bunch of possible ideas ranging from "it's fine already" to really
complicated memory-mapping schemes. This is a wishlist TODO rather than a
must-have, but noted down nonetheless just as a reminder for some rainy day in
the future.

Somewhat-low-ish-hanging fruit:
* Base64 instead of hex
* Shared string pool thingy
* Pool the actual task_result structs together
