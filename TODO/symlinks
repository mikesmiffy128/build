Do something about infile symlinks
====
Initially, it's probably not worth too much fuss to care about this, but
*technically* if we wanna be super robust we should implicitly note the whole
symlink trail as an infile, although directory symlinks midway through the path
can probably be ignored??? Either that or aliased to the real path.

Requires *some* thought, but doesn't have to be well-defined behaviour right
away - we can just cross the relevant bridge when we get there.

Update: current behaviour treats an infile as a *path*, and symlinks just do
what symlinks do. I think this is fine, but this item is still open to further
consideration for now.
